# StopFraud_DEMO
 ## StopFraud Demo developed and used at the Startup Valencia Cybersecurity Hackathon and winner of 2025 edition.

This demo demonstrates how a ticketing company (ex. Fourvenues) would see embedded in their own system, a dashboard with a list of the events and their actual status (Pending, Verified, Fraudulent). It also has a lot of statistics inside of each event.

The demo it's only to show the actual use of the fraud section. You can see this by clicking on the "Fraud" section in the left sidebar.
